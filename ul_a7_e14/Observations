* We do not get the same results even if we run the algorithm multiple times with the same number of clusters
(see Experiments.jpg where we have a subplot for each number of clusters and each experiment). This is because
of the random initialization of the cluster centroids, which results in different points being assigned to the
clusters in each experiment.

* We can notice that the algorithm fails to detect the real clusters. Since it uses the simple 2D distance
between points, each cluster will have a "circle"-like shape, not managing to capture the eliptical shape
of the real clusters. This is also due to the fact that k-means' clusters have the same shapes.
