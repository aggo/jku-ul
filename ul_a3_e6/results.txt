How:
1) We fit a PCA to the data without giving a number of components to be kept in order to
   obtain for each component the amount of variance it accounts for.
2) For each of the "Experiments" (i.e. desired percentages of variance to be kept), we compute
   how many principal components we need to account for that amount of variance.
   2.1) We fit another PCA with this number of components and then we transform the initial data
        using these principal components. Ex: for 50% variance preserved, we only need 4 PCs (fig. C0_P0.5 tp C3_P0.5)
   2.2) To decompress the data again, we make a linear combination of the computed principal
        components and the transformed data. (see fig. 2 for an example of a 50%-preserved-variance
        image and how it was obtained. The a-b-c-d values are just numbers)

The type of information that is preserved is the main characteristics of the face and the bigger traits that
"distinguishe" one particular face from the others (for example, the locations where hair is present, how big are the
eyebrows/nose, etc.)

What is lost is detail - the images become increasingly "blurry". (see fig. 1)
