As one can notice in figure_1.png, the following sites can be roughly separated using
1) only the first component:
   - cp (red) - but it overlaps a bit with pp (cyan)
    (see figure 2 - the black line "delimits" the group)

2) only the second component:
   - pp (cyan) - but it still overlaps with a few; however, delimited from red and yellow
    (see figure 3)

3) the first and the second component
   - cp (red), pp (cyan), im (yellow)
