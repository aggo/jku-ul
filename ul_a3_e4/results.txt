First component for dataset1:
[-0.73311762 -0.17890666  0.65614858]
Percent of data explained by the first component for ds1:
0.345002280658

First component for dataset2:
[ 0.67354117  0.73914971]
Percent of data explained by the first component for ds2:
0.775567775989

It is clear that more variance is explained in case of the second dataset.

One can notice from the visualization that the points are spread relatively uniformly
(somehow making a cube) in the case of data set 1.

In the plot of the second dataset one can distinguish a diagonal direction on which if
the data was projected, it would separate two of the "clusters" one can easily identify
in the initial plot (see fig. 3)
